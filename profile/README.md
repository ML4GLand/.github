ML4GLand is a community for that develops and maintains tools (primarily in Python) for genomics sequence based machine learning.

MLGLand currently contains the following core packages organized into tiers based on dependencies
- Tier 1: Only 
  - `SeqPro`
- Tier 2: Needs Tier 1

  - `SeqExplainer` 
- Tier 3: Needs Tier 1 and a one or more from Tier 2
  -  `SeqDatasets`
- Tier 4: Needs Tier 1, 2 and 3
  -  `EUGENe`
 
ML4GLand also has repositories that showcase the usage of these packages
  1. tutorials and guides
  2. replications of published work
